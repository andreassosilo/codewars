// 8 kyu - Swap Values

/*
Task:
-----
I would like to be able to pass an array with two elements to my
swapValues function to swap the values. However it appears that the
values aren't changing. Can you figure out what's wrong here?
*/

const swapValues = arr => arr.reverse()

// TEST CASES
var arr = [1, 2]
console.log(swapValues(arr))
