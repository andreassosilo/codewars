Task:

A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares.
And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an
ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're
currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of
building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of
an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic
typed languages.

var isSquare = function (n) {
  // Using Math.sqrt() to find if the square root is integer or not
  // Check it using modulus
  return Math.sqrt(n) % 1 === 0
}
// TEST CASES
console.log(isSquare(-1)) // false
console.log(isSquare(0)) // true
console.log(isSquare(4)) // true
console.log(isSquare(26)) // false
